# Bottom-up Saliency Model


## Description

Detect visual saliency from video or images.

*NOTES*:

- USB camera option available but currently getting slow FPS.

## Using the Docker image

If you don't want to build from source you can use the docker image to run the program.

### Setup

1. Install Docker Desktop: <https://www.docker.com/get-started>
2. Check that Docker works from the command line. From a terminal type: `docker --version`.
3. Obtain the docker image `saliency-image.tar` containing the built saliency program
4. In a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the docker image and load it with `docker load -i saliency-image.tar`
5. Run the image by entering the command `docker run -it --rm saliency-app:0.1.0`. You should see the saliency program help documentation.

### Configure

#### Editing `docker-compose.yml`

Open up the file `docker-compose.yml` in any text editor. The fields that need to be changed are `environment`, `command`, and `source`.

- `source`: `volumes: source:` maps a directory on your host machine to a directory inside the docker container. E.g., `source: /path/to/my/data`. If your data is located on your computer at `~/videos`, then use the full absolute path such as `source: $USERPROFILE/videos` on windows or `source: $HOME/videos` for unix-based system.

- `command`: These are the command-line arguments passed to the saliency program. If you want to specify a video to use, use the relative path from the mapped volume. E.g., `--vid=my_video.avi` that is located in `~/videos`.

- `environment`: Change `DISPLAY=#.#.#.#:0.0` to whatever your IP address is. If your IP address is `192.168.0.101` then the field would be `- DISPLAY=192.168.0.101:0.0`. This setting is required for displaying output windows. See `Displaying windows` section below.

#### Running `docker-compose.yml`

After configuring `docker-compose.yml`, run the `saliency` service by entering this in the terminal:

```
docker-compose run --rm saliency
```

#### Displaying windows

When running from the docker container, the saliency program tries to show windows of the saliency output. These windows are generated by OpenCV and require access to the display. This access is operating system dependent, and without some way to map the display from the container to your own host machine you will generate an error such as `Can't initialize GTK backend in function 'cvInitSystem'`.

##### Windows

1. Download and install VcXsrv from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/
2. Run XLaunch and use all the default settings except for the last where it says "Disable access control." Make sure its selected.

You should now be able to run the program and see the output windows.

##### OSX

TODO

## Building from source

You'll need

- OpenCV (>=4.5.0) https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.5.0.zip
- CMake Binary distribution https://cmake.org/download/

### Windows

TODO: OpenCV Build instructions

...

You'll also need to add the `opencv_videoio_ffmpeg*` library to the same folder as the program in order to read videos with non-standard codecs (e.g., on Windows, locate file `opencv_videoio_ffmpeg450_64.dll` and place in the folder that contains `saliency.exe`).


### OSX

Use Homebrew to grab the dependencies: https://brew.sh/

After Homebrew is installed, run:

```
brew update
brew install cmake opencv ffmpeg
```

After the dependencies are installed navigate to the repository folder `cd /path/to/saliency`. Then run:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install -- -j 4
cd ..
```

The compiled binaries will be in `./saliency/bin`. Test using the samples data:

```
cd saliency
./bin/saliency --vid=share/samples/vtest.avi
```

Hold the "ESC" key down to quit (make sure the saliency output window is selected).

## Program Help Output

Running `./saliency --help` will show the following output:

```
Usage: saliency [params]

        -?, -h, --help
                print this help message
        --alt_exit
                sets program exit to right click on main image
        --cam
                usb camera index, use 0 for default
        --debug
                toggle visualization of feature parameters
        --dir
                full path to where root saliency output directory will be created
        --img
                full path to image file
        --par
                full path to the YAML parameters file
        --split
                output will be saved as a series of images instead of video
        --vid
                full path to video file
```
